# TinyRenderer Clone - A Minimal Software Renderer  

This project is a minimal software renderer based on the **TinyRenderer** tutorial by [Dmitry Sokolov](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer). The goal is to build a simple rasterizer from scratch, understanding the fundamental principles of computer graphics without relying on external libraries like OpenGL or DirectX.  

If I messed something up, your interested in my work on this, please do not hesitate to reach out to me <a href="mailto:wilver.santos84@gmail.com"><b>via email! (Wilver.Santos84@gmail.com)</b></a>

## ðŸš€ Features  

- Renders a 3D model using a basic rasterization pipeline  
- Reads 3D model files (`.obj`) and renders them as wireframes or shaded triangles  
- Implements a simple shading technique (flat shading)  
- Uses only **C++ and a basic image library (TGA output)**  

## ðŸ“– Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

To compile and run the project, you need:  

- A C++ compiler (`g++`, `clang++`, or MSVC)  
- `make` (optional, for building with Makefile)  

### Installation & Compilation  

Clone the repository:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tiny-renderer-clone.git
cd tiny-renderer-clone
